                        <p>When most people think of a rocket, they think of a
                            tall round vehicle that


                            flies into space. But the word "rocket" can mean two different things. The word can describe
                            a
                            type


                            A rocket (originated from the Italian word Rochette) is a spacecraft, aircraft, vehicle, or
                            projectile that obtains thrust from a rocket engine.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="info-lec-pa">

                    <div class="info-lec-1pa" style="color: aliceblue;">
                        <p>A launchpad is a platform from which a rocket is launched, and they're found at facilities
                            called
                            launch complexes or spaceports.
                            A typical launch pad consists of a pad and a launch mount, a metal structure that supports
                            the
                            upright rocket before it launches. Umbilical cables from the launch mount provide the rocket
                            with power, cooling liquids, and top-up propellant before launch. The structure also helps
                            shield the rocket from lightning strikes.</p>
                        <p>
                            Different launch complexes have different ways of putting rockets on launch pads. At NASA's
                            Kennedy Space Center, the space shuttle was assembled vertically and moved to the launch pad
                            on
                            a tank-like vehicle called a crawler. The Russian space program transports rockets
                            horizontally
                            by train to the launch pad, where they're then lifted upright.</p>

                        <p>
                            Launchpads also have features that minimize damage from the rocket's launch. When a rocket
                            first
                            ignites, valves lining the launchpad spray hundreds of thousands of gallons of water into
                            the
                            air around the exhaust, which helps lessen the rocket's deafening roar. Trenches beneath the
                            launch pad also direct the rocket's exhaust out and away from the craft, so the flames can't
                            rise back up and engulf the rocket itself.

                            The first known rockets were used in China in the 1200s. These solid rockets were used for
                            fireworks. They also were used by armies for war. In the 1300s, these rockets were used for
                            the
                            same purposes through much of Asia and Europe. In the next 600 years, people developed
                            bigger
                            and better solid rockets. Many of these were used by the military.</p>
                        <p>
                            In 1903, a Russian teacher named Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote a paper describing the idea of
                            liquid-fuel rockets. In 1926, American scientist Robert Goddard flew the first liquid-fuel
                            rocket. German scientists led by Hermann Oberth improved liquid-fuel rockets. During World
                            War
                            II, Germany used rockets to bomb other countries. In 1957, the Soviet Union used a rocket to
                            launch the first satellite. In 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin rode in a rocket to
                            become
                            the first person in space. In 1969, the United States launched the first men to land on the
                            moon
                            - Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin - using a Saturn V rocket.

                            One of the biggest differences between the rockets of early science fiction and the actual
                            ones
                            that took people into space was that the real rockets had multiple stages that fell away as
                            the
                            rocket left Earth.</p>
                        <p>
                            The stages reflect the need to carry a lot of fuel to allow the rocket to escape Earth’s
                            gravitational pull. When the fuel tanks are empty, they’re just extra mass that needs to be
                            accelerated, wasting fuel.
                            By dropping off a stage when its fuel is exhausted (or having disposable external tanks like
                            the
                            Space Shuttle), the remaining craft becomes much lighter, needing less fuel to accelerate
                            it.

                        <p>There are four major components to any full scale rocket; the structural system, or frame,
                            the
                            payload system, the guidance system, and the propulsion system. The propulsion of a rocket
                            includes all of the parts which make up the rocket engine; the tanks pumps, propellants,
                            power
                            head, and rocket nozzle.

                            Rockets consist of a propellant, a place to put propellant (such as a propellant tank), and
                            a
                            nozzle. They may also have one or more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s)
                            (such
                            as fins, vernier engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes), and a
                            structure
                            (typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high-speed
                            atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which usually holds
                            the
                            payload.

                        <p>
                            As well as these components, rockets can have any number of other components, such as wings
                            (rocketplanes), parachutes, wheels (rocket cars), even, in a sense, a person (rocket belt).
                            Vehicles frequently possess navigation systems and guidance systems that typically use
                            satellite
                            navigation and inertial navigation systems.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a rocket engine, fuel and a source of oxygen, called an oxidizer, are mixed and exploded
                            in a
                            combustion chamber. The
                            combustion produces hot exhaust which is passed through a nozzle to accelerate the flow and
                            produce thrust. For a
                            rocket, the accelerated gas, or working fluid, is the hot exhaust produced during
                            combustion.
                            This is a different
                            working fluid than you find in a gas turbine engine or propeller-powered aircraft. Turbine
                            engines and propellers use
                            air from the atmosphere as the working fluid, but rockets use combustion exhaust gases. In
                            outer
                            space, there is no
                            atmosphere so turbines and propellers can not work there. This explains why a rocket works
                            in
                            space but a turbine engine
                            or a propeller does not work.

                            A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a payload
                            from
                            Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. A launch system includes the
                            launch
                            vehicle, launch pad, vehicle assembly and fuelling systems, range safety, and other related
                            infrastructure.</p>

                            Rocket vehicles are often constructed in the archetypal tall thin "rocket" shape that takes
                            off
                            vertically, but there are actually many different types of rockets including:

                                    Non-rocket space launch refers to concepts for launch into space where much of the

                                    subject to the limits of the rocket equation.A number of alternatives to rockets
                                    have
                                    been proposed. In some systems, such as a combination launch system, skyhook, rocket
                                    sled launch, rockoon, or air launch, a portion of the total delta-v may be provided,
                                    either directly or indirectly, by using rocket propulsion.

                                    Space launch is the earliest part of a flight that reaches space. Space launch
                                    involves
                                    liftoff, when a rocket or other space launch vehicle leaves the ground, floating
                                    ship or
                                    midair aircraft at the start of a flight. Liftoff is of two main types: rocket
                                    launch
                                    (the current conventional method), and non-rocket space launch (where other forms of
                                    propulsion are employed, including airbreathing jet engines or other kinds). In

                                    An expendable launch system or (ELV) is a launch vehicle that can be launched only
                                    once,
                                    after which its components are either destroyed during reentry or discarded in
                                    space.
                                    ELVs typically consist of several rocket stages that are discarded sequentially as
                                    their
                                    fuel is exhausted and the vehicle gains altitude and speed. As of October 2019, most
                                    satellites and human spacecraft are currently launched on ELVS. ELVS are simpler in
                                    design than reusable launch systems and therefore may have a lower production cost.
                                    Furthermore, an ELV can use its entire fuel supply to accelerate its payload,
                                    offering
                                    greater payloads. ELVs are proven technology in widespread use for many decades.

                                    A reusable launch system is a launch system that allows for the reuse of some or all

                                    several fully reusable suborbital systems and partially reusable orbital systems
                                    have
                                    been flown. The first reusable
                                    launch vehicle to reach orbit was the Space Shuttle (in 1981), which failed to
                                    accomplish the intended goal of reducing
                                    launch costs to below those of expendable launch systems.

                                    A solid-propellant rocket or solid rocket is a rocket with a rocket engine that uses
                                    solid
                                    propellants (fuel/ oxidizer). The earliest rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered
                                    by
                                    gunpowder; they were used in warfare by the Chinese, Indians, Mongols and Persians,
                                    as
                                    early as the 13th century. All rockets used some form of solid or powdered

                                    until the 20th century, when liquid-propellant rockets offered more efficient and
                                    controllable alternatives. Solid rockets are still used today in military armaments
                                    worldwide, model rockets, solid rocket boosters and on larger applications for their
                                    simplicity and reliability.

                                    A liquid-propellant rocket or liquid rocket utilizes a rocket engine that uses
                                    liquid
                                    propellants. Liquids are desirable
                                    because they have a reasonably high density and high specific impulse (Isp). This
                                    allows
                                    the volume of the propellant
                                    tanks to be relatively low. It is also possible to use lightweight centrifugal
                                    turbopumps to pump the rocket propellant
                                    from the tanks into the combustion chamber, which means that the propellants can be
                                    kept
                                    under low pressure. This
                                    permits the use of low-mass propellant tanks that do not need to resist the high
                                    pressures needed to store significant
                                    amounts of gases, resulting in a low mass ratio for the rocket.
