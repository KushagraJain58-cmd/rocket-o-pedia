                    <p>Rocket science is all about using rocket propulsion to move anything from a firework to a manned
                        spaceship. At the heart of rocketry is Isaac Newton’s Third Law of Motion, something that’s been
                        established for over 300 years. It says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If
                        you stand in front of a wall and push it hard, you will move backward.
                        Similarly, if you stand on a skateboard and throw a heavy object away from you as hard as you
                        can (don’t try this at home), you’ll roll in the opposite direction. As you push an object
                        forwards, the object pushes back on you with the same amount of force.In a rocket, the ‘object’
                        being pushed is the end product of burning fuel, which shoots out of the back of the rocket as
                        the fuel burns, forcing the rocket to move in the opposite direction.

                    <p>Not at all. There are three basic requirements to a working rocket: get it moving, overcome the
                        pull of gravity and plot a course. Each of these depends on physics that has been known since
                        Newton’s day.
                        Rocketry in empty space is easy, but on Earth we have to overcome our planet’s gravity..The
                        acceleration to get Verne’s shell to the required 11.2km per second would squish the passengers
                        inside. But a rocket can accelerate more gently for as long as its fuel lasts, gradually
                        climbing out of the Earth’s gravity.
                    </p>
                    <p>When it comes to plotting a course, once again, all we need is Newton’s physics, which allows us
                        to understand how the flight path will be affected by the gravitational pulls of the Earth, the
                        Sun and the Moon (the other planets will have influences too but these are small in a local
                        flight), plus any ‘burns’ of the rocket engine.
                        What makes successful rocketry so difficult isn’t so much the science as the engineering.
                        There’s so much complex technology in a rocket that it’s incredibly tough to be sure that
                        everything is going to work.

                    <p>The reason we need the power of vast rocket motors, like those used to get astronauts to the
                        International Space Station, is the difficulty of getting away from the Earth’s gravitational
                        pull. This takes a lot of (heavy) fuel, which is why we can’t land on the Earth using rockets
                        the way the Apollo lunar module did on the Moon.

                        Like many other engines, a rocket produces thrust by burning fuel. Most rocket engines turn the
                        fuel into a hot gas. Pushing the gas out of the back of the engine makes the rocket move
                        forward.
                        Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket. Rocket
                        engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust
                        in
                        the opposite direction at high speed and can therefore work in the vacuum of space.</p>
                    <p>
                        A rocket is different from a jet engine. A jet engine requires oxygen from the air to work. A
                        rocket engine carries
                        everything it needs. That is why a rocket engine works in space, where there is no air.
                        There are two main types of rocket engines. Some rockets use liquid fuel. The main engines on
                        the space shuttle orbiter
                        use liquid fuel. The Russian Soyuz uses liquid fuels. Other rockets use solid fuels. On the side
                        of the space shuttle
                        are two white Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB). They use solid fuels. Fireworks and model rockets
                        also fly using solid
                        fuels.

                        In the vacuum of space, an engine has nothing to push against. So how do rockets move there?
                        Rockets work by a scientific rule called Newton's third law of motion. English scientist Sir
                        Isaac Newton listed three Laws of Motion more than 300 years ago. </p>
                    <p>
                        The third law says that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When the
                        rocket pushes out its
                        exhaust, the exhaust also pushes the rocket. The rocket pushes the exhaust backward. The exhaust
                        makes the rocket move
                        forward. This rule can be seen on Earth. If a person stands on a skateboard and throws a bowling
                        ball, the person and
                        the ball will move in opposite directions. Because the person is heavier, the bowling ball will
                        move farther.
