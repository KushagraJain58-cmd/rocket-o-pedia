                    <p>Rockets play a huge role in our daily life of every living species.Most of people reading this
                        article have basic idea what is rocket is or what it is used for but what you may not know how
                        rockets affects our daily life.The device your are reading this is because of internet and
                        communications which is possible due satellites launched by a rocket.The car you are travelling
                        may have GPS which works due satellite launched by rockets.Rockets help to take scientific
                        equipments to space.
                        <p>Rockets play a major role in space exploration.They our only medium to
                            take anything out of earth.to make humans multiplanetary species rockets plays a vital
                            factor.It is due to rockets we were able to go to the Moon or we were able to launch
                            different rovers to Moon and Mars.Due to rockets we are able to find what are new things in
                            our space. Many rockets are launched by various organizations daily.Recently 2 big space
                            companies launched normal citizens into space. </p>

                    <p>Rockets are used to launch satellites and Space Shuttles into space. Their powerful engines allow
                        spacecraft to be blasted into space at incredible speeds, putting them into the correct orbit.

                        Rockets are now used for fireworks, weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial
                        satellites, human spaceflight, and space exploration. Chemical rockets are the most common type
                        of high-power rocket, typically creating a high-speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an
                        oxidizer.
                        Rockets can be used by the military to deliver ordinances (bombs) over short and very long
                        distances. Rockets are propelled forward by their engine using liquid or solid propellant
                        (fuel).

                        Rockets have since been used to send spacecraft farther into our solar system: past the moon,
                        Venus and Mars in the early 1960s, which later expanded into the exploration of dozens of moons
                        and planets.<br><br>

                        Differernt uses of rockets in various fields are:

                                Some military weapons use rockets to propel warheads to their targets. A rocket and its
                                payload together are generally
                                referred to as a missile when the weapon has a guidance system (not all missiles use
                                rocket engines, some use other
                                engines such as jets) or as a rocket if it is unguided. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft
                                missiles use rocket engines to
                                engage targets at high speed at a range of several miles, while intercontinental
                                ballistic missiles can be used to
                                deliver multiple nuclear warheads from thousands of miles, and anti-ballistic missiles
                                try to stop them.

                                Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites, which are
                                used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain the only way to launch
                                spacecraft into orbit and beyond. They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft
                                when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing. Also, a rocket may be used to soften a
                                hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown.
